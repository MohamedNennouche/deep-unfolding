# Tutorials

In this folder, you'll find tutorials on how to use the various models and functions in the `deep_unfolding` package, specifically:

- `iterative.ipynb`: A notebook that groups together the conventional iterative approaches to solving linear systems proposed in this package.
- `deep_unfolding.ipynb`: A notebook that provides an example of how to use one of our models based on deep unfolding learning to improve performance over its conventional version.

To best use these notebooks, install the requirements, e.g. in a virtual environment:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
