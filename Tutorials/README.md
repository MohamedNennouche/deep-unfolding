# Tutorials

In this folder, you'll find tutorials on how to use the various models and functions in the `deep_unfolding` package, specifically:

- `methods.ipynb`: A notebook that groups together the conventional iterative approaches to solving linear systems proposed in this package.
- `train_methods.ipynb`: A notebook that provides an example of how to use one of our models based on deep unfolding learning to improve performance over its conventional version.
